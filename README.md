# MeetArts Virtual Gallery
This repository contains the first version of the virtual gallery that I developed for MeetArts (available at https://meetarts-vr.org), hosted for demonstration purposes. It offers an immersive digital art experience for viewers, who can browse through the artworks through first-person POV. <br><br>
Note: Only accessible on laptop/ PC. Mobile devices are not supported.
